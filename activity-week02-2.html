         <h2> [Short Description] </h2>
         <p> This project tests the web-accessibility and SEO of seven museum websites. It shows how web-accessibility and SEO are connected and how to improve both. </p>
         <p> Web-accessibility is important because we want to create an experience that is available to everyone, regardless of any disabilities. It is important to measure accessibility and SEO scores to improve web accessibility and to determine how to resolve the issues that are preventing accessibility. </p> <br>
         <h2> [Research] </h2>
         <p> I tested the websites of the American Museum of Natural History, The MET, California Science Center, MoMA, the Louvre, the Museum of Ice Cream, and the Uffizi. I utilized Google Chrome's development tool Lighthouse to generate a report on the accessibility and SEO scores of each website. Through this investigation, I learned that accessibility and SEO are related, and having a higher SEO score typically improves accessibility. Case in point, many of the websites that had a high SEO score also generally had a high accessibility score. Some of the common issues that lowered accessibility scores were contrast issues, no discernible names for links, and navigation issues. One of the websites, the Louvre, had perfect accessibility and SEO scores, and while navigating the website, I found it very easy and clear to follow. The lowest SEO score was 75, which was for the California Science Center, and the lowest accessibility score was 81 for the Museum of Ice Cream. The California Science Center had a low SEO score because document does not have meta description, links do not have descriptive test, and links are not crawlable. The Museum of Ice Cream had a low accessibility score because buttons do not have an accessible name, image elements do not have alternative text, links do not have a discernible name, and buttons have low contrast. Overall, many of these websites were mostly accessible, but there is room for improvement to make it even more accessible. The Louvre's website is the model website. </p> <br>
